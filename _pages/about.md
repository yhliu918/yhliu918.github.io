Hi! I'm Yihao Liu, a third-year PHD student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by [Huanchen Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huanchen/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Yuanpei College, Peking University.
My research interest includes resource optimization problems in cloud database systems and lightweight compression techniques. I'm also closely following the works about machine learning systems and AI4science.

Recently, we are building a clever distributed execution engine on the cloud. 

My personal hobbies include classical music (big fan of Daniel Barenboim and Janine Jansen), singing ,and traveling. 

Currently practicing Deutsch. Danke f√ºr ihre Aufmerksamkeit.
