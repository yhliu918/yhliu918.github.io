Hi! I'm Yihao Liu, a third-year PHD student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by [Huanchen Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huanchen/). My research interest includes cloud database system resource optimization and lightweight compression techniques. 

Recently, we are building a clever distributed execution engine on cloud. 
I'm also closely following the works about machine learning systems and AI4science.

My personal hobbies include classical music (big fan of Daniel Barenboim and Janine Jansen), singing and traveling. 

Currently practicing Deutsch. Danke f√ºr ihre Aufmerksamkeit.
